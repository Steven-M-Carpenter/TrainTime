# TrainTime

####Overview
This project was assigned as homework and demonstrates the concepts of front-end development and data persistance learned through the coursework thus far.  The concept includes providing a capability to define a route and having that route persist between sessions.  The project also includes the ability to calculate arrivals based on stored data and system time. 

The project stands out as the first instance where I incorporated another JS library into something I wrote.  The referenced `timepicker.js` is used to constrain time entry and format the input in a meaninggul way.  In addition, it represents my first excursion into the capabilities of CSS as it relates to linear-gradients and text shadowing.

####Usage
Enter a new route in the space provided to include it in the list of monitored trains.
Monitor the status section to see the train's status change to reflect the arrival in relation to the current time.
